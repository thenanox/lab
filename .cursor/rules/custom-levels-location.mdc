      When creating custom level files:

      1. Always place level files in the data directory:
         ```
         data/
         ├── level1.json
         ├── level2.json
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use levelN.json format where N is the level number
         - Always use .json extension

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── data/
         │   ├── level1.json
         │   ├── level2.json
         │   └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place level files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside data
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Level file in wrong location
      level5.json
      levels/level5.json
      src/data/level5.json

      # Good: Level file in correct location
      data/level5.json
    output: "Correctly placed custom level file"
